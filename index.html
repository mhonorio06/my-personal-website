          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Manny Fernandez and I live in Phoenix, Arizona. I graduated from Florence High School and I received an Associates in Arts degree from Glendale Community College. I have been working
            in the manufacturing of semi conductors until I decided I wanted to make a change into programming. After speaking to a few people in the industry, of where I should go to study, I decided that Flatiron School was the choice for me. I am now looking to further my knowledge and career in the world
            of software engineering. Thank you for visiting my portfolio and I hope to meet all of you soon with the prospect of gaining employment in an exciting career!</p>
